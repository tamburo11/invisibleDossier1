In this audio-optical instrument, the sounds and lights seem to come from everywhere, those genetic places that have contributed to their modelling, to their sculpture. No traditional speakers. No direct acoustic sounds. Only simple sonic symbols: vibrating squares and rectangles. Only raw materials: metal shining plates. Everything through these.

The result is a vaguely dystopian, at times ritual, audio-visual experience, in which the classical instrumental heritage, decontextualized and literally tele-transported, seems to be entrusted with the only solitary role of memory of a naked humanity. <br><br>The rest is artifice, through a sound-light history of the industrial revolutions. 


These symbolized by cold plates, creaking motors, computers and codes, which control the entire performance, in search of a personal musicality of the present.

A reflection on the impossibility of anti-human, as well.
