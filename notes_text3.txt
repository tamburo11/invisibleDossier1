In the system there are not traditional speakers, nor direct acoustic sounds. There are only simple sonic symbols: vibrating squares and rectangles; only raw materials: metal shining plates. Everything is mediated by these and by the algorithms that control them: electronic sound synthesis; real-time digital signal processing; lo-fi sound diffusion and spatialization; automation of movement; image-processing; unconventional projections.

The result is a vaguely dystopian, at times ritualistic, experience, in which the classical instrumental heritage, decontextualized and literally tele-transported, seems to be entrusted with the solitary task of bearing human memory. The rest is artifice, through a sound-light history of industrial revolutions, symbolized by cold plates, creaking motors, computers and codes; the elements which control the entire performance. The elements we must confront with today. The (s)objects we must be aware of, so as not to be overwhelmed.
