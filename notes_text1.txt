<i>Invisible through Bach</i> is an immersive sound-visual art work composed between 2018 and 2019, for an architecture of resonant/reflective motorized metal plates, cello, live electronics and live visual art. Presented for <a href="http://www.oggimusica.ch/" target="_blank">OGGIMUSICA</a> and <a href="http://www.luganomusica.ch/" target="_blank">LuganoMusica</a>, at the theatre <a href="https://www.luganolac.ch/" target="_blank"> LAC</a> (Lugano - CH) on 19 March 2019, it is the result of a collaboration with cellist Giacomo Cardelli and visual artist Rajan Craveri, and it was supported by the <a href="http://delz.ch/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Christoph Delz Foundation</a>. 

<br><br>

<i>Invisible through Bach</i> is a vibrating techno-human organism, a multi-perceptual installation, a system of dense sound-visual interconnections, which leads the public to live a pluri-sensorial experience - a strongly emotive one - shared between people, automata and codes. Essentially, it's an art work which reflects on todayâ€™s human-machine integration and mutual influences, with a hope for the impossibility of an anti-human drift.
