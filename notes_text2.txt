The performance takes place in two separate spaces: one shared between the public and an installation of metal plates sound diffusors, and the other inhabited by a cellist alone. These two spaces together, strongly interconnected by audio-video signals, give life to an all-embracing electro-mechanical environment, where reality and virtuality seem to switch roles.

Hanging aluminium plates, transducers, micro-processors, electric motors and evolving lights: all combined to form a unique ‘instrument’, capable of generating audio and light on its own, as well as to allow access to the cellist, who, invisible and inaudible, is never really revealed, but who constantly strives to access the system, to influence it.

In <i>Invisible through Bach</i>, some distillate acoustic traditional gestures, modelled on J.S. Bach's Suite BWV 1007 and therefore bearers of collective memory, are integrated in a rich microcosm of technological relationships, that also express the urges of the electronic music world: industrial, techno, IDM, drone, noise, etc.. Looking for integration rather than divergence.
