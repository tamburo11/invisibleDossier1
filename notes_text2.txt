<i>Invisible through Bach</i> is a vibrating organism. A multi-perceptual installation. An architecture of dense sound-visual interconnections, which leads the public to live a pluri-sensorial experience. A strongly emotive one, shared between human beings, electrical machines, automata and codes. 

<br><br>A reflection on todays's human-machines synergy.

<br><br>In <i>Invisible through Bach</i>, an all-embracing system stands out as the only medium of expression. And the audience inhabits the center of this electro-mechanic environment, that is in telematic dialog with an extra space where a lonely human being, a cellist, seems to be exiled.
<br><br>

Sixteen hanging aluminium plates, transducers and sound exciters, micro-processors, electric motors and projected evolving lights: a medium that is both capable of generating music and light informations by itself, and allowing access to the external sound gestures of a cellist. Who, invisible and inaudible, is never really revealed. Who constantly strives to access the system, to influence it.
<br><br>
A reflection on the condition of human exile, too.
<br><br>
The intent is the creation of a single techno-human organism, where the remote acoustic string gestures, modelled on some movements of the J.S. Bach's Suite BWV 1007, and therefore bearers of collective memory, are integrated in a rich microcosm of biunivocal technological relationships. Electronic synthesis and real-time digital signal processing. Sound spatialization and video capture. Mechanical automations. <br><br>
